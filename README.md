# What I Use

This repository contains most of my userspace configuration files,
a handful of scripts and fonts.

## Personal Workstation

Whenever I'm off work or not on campus I use the first generation [Framework](https://frame.work) laptop with an Intel i5-1135G7, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. There are some drawbacks compared to the ThinkPads I was using previously but overall it's a very nice machine.

* Operating System: [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org)-current
* Editor: [Vim](https://www.vim.org)
* X11 Window Manager: [i3](https://i3wm.org)
* Miscellaneous:
  * [slock](https://tools.suckless.org/slock) to turn the screen off while locked
  * [gh](https://cli.github.com) to interact with [GitHub](https://github.com) from the command line
  * [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
